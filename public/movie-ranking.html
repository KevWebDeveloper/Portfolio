            <h1>The Best Movies According to KEVIN</h1>
            <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
            <br />
            <h3>Lord Of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
            <p>Love the story line, all of the subplots within the main story.</p>
            <h3>With Honors</h3>
            <p>The theme of this movie is about how to be kind and not to judge people until you know their back story</p>
            <h3>Rocky</h3>
            <p>I have a lot of respect for Sly Stallone and how he never gave up his dream to become an actor and he never sold out.</p>
